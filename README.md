# extract-bootstat
This tool extract boot times from a Microsoft Windows Machine for IR/DFIR (Forensics) by parsing the `bootstat.dat` which is located in `C:\Windows\bootstat.dat`.

This Project is inspired by [PSBits/Extract-BootTimes.ps1](https://github.com/gtworek/PSBits/blob/master/DFIR/Extract-BootTimes.ps1).
The main reason for rewriting this in Rust is I don't like to work with winblows and get started in using Rust.
